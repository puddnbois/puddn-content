# Welcome to the Puddn Career Fair of Autumn 2022 
The Puddn Career Fair is a chance for you to apply to entry level roles by 

## Here is how it works 

1) You must first be signed up to Puddn 
2) You must have done either ** ONE ** impressive project or ** ONE ** open source contribution 
3) You can pick any career fair project, and build it out. Similar to the work you have been doing in the past, you'll be able to submit work on to the platform itself
4) Each project shouldn't take more than a few hours to a few days to do. The time you spend working isn't the important bit, which brings us to judging criteria 
5) Projects submitted must have source code and a working demo. In industry, you will be expected to deploy your code and this shouldn't be any different.
6) Demos can be in the form of a live demo (highly recommended) or a video (still accepted), or both (very highly recommended)

## Judging Criteria 

I didn't build this roadmap because I didn't think you couldn't do it - everyone on this roadmap knows you are an entry level applicant and it's my job to help defend your application. 
I will select the best applications and to do that, I have several criteria on finding the best ones to show our career fair patrons. 

For all Projects: 
1) How close your website is according to the requirements of the projects
2) Whether the skills you used in your project match the requirements of the project
3) The way you worked - the way you wrote your code, the way you worked, your Git commit message etc. 
4) How good your demo is and the way you communicate

For Full Stack projects: 
Your Google Lighthouse Score: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Lighthouse) will be taken into consideration 

For Data Science projects: 
How you performed against the evaluation metric will be taken into consideration
